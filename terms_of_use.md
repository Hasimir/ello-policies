# Ello Terms of Use
#### Updated June 20, 2014

Even though you may feel that reading the Terms of Use of a service like Ello is a boring waste of time, we highly recommend that you read Ello's.

Your privacy is a big deal to us, and by choosing to use Ello, you are bound to the terms of this agreement — which is binding. That means that if you don’t agree to these Terms, please don’t use Ello.

This is a contract between you and Ello, Inc. (“Ello”, “us”, “we”), which is applicable when you use our web sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Ello, globally, in existence now or in the future, forever and ever (“Ello Services” or “Service”).

## When You Post on Ello
We don’t claim ownership over anything that you own and that you post on Ello. However, when you post or transfer content to Ello, you give us permission without limitation to use it in such a way that we can display, store, reproduce, and distribute it.

When you post on Ello, you are agreeing to allow others to view your content.

We have the right (though no obligation) to refuse or remove any content you post or transfer to Ello for any reason.

We will never sell your content for use by third parties without your permission.

You may delete your content from Ello or ask us to delete your account at any time. However, there may be a delay between your request and when the content or account is publicly visible due to technical or operational limitations. Note that we do retain backups of user content on our servers, and some of your content may remain on our servers (though not publicly visible) even after you ask to have it deleted. If you delete your account or content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.

You are responsible for the things you submit to Ello. You assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual propety claims, or any other legal rights claims. When you post text, photos, videos, or other content on Ello, you represent that you have the rights to post that content on Ello. You may not impersonate others.

We may modify our Services at any time, since Ello is a constantly changing and evolving service. We may delete or modify to any part or all of this service at any time, without notice. If the changes we make are significant we will let you know by posting a notice on our web site, or by email. This notice will be designated as a reasonable amount of time after which the new terms will go into effect. If you don’t agree with the new terms, please delete your account before the end of the notice period.

## User Activity
If you haven't uploaded a profile picture or header image within 60 days of creating your account, we may remove your account and allow another user to select your username. We will send you a warning e-mail before doing so.

Also, if you haven't logged into your account for 365 days, we may delete your account to make room for new users. Again, we will send you a warning e-mail to let you know that your account is about to be removed, giving you a chance to log in and keep your account.

You must use and maintain a valid e-mail address, or your account will be deleted.

If you use a robot to post on Ello, or to sign up for multiple accounts, or to follow lots of other users, we may delete your account. If you follow too many other users we may delete your account if we feel you are not acting like a human being.

## Content
Ello, Inc. owns all rights to our logo, services, apps, and our website, including any intellectual property rights related to it. You may not reuse, copy, or duplicate any part of the site, including the Ello HTML/CSS, JavaScipt, logos, or visual design elements without express written permission from Ello.

## Privacy
When you use Ello, you consent to the Ello [Privacy Policy](https://ello.co/wtf/post/privacy).

## No Children Under 13
You need to be 13 years or older to use Ello. If you’re under 13, please don’t use Ello. If we learn that you or anyone else is under 13 and is using Ello, we’ll close the child’s account.

## Security and Responsible Disclosures
We do our best to protect our service from security vulnerabilities, and to make Ello better. You can read about this in our [Security Policy](https://ello.co//wtf/post/security).

## Ello’s Rules
Ello has rules that all users must follow. You can find them [here](https://ello.co//wtf/post/rules).

## DMCA Copyright Policy
