# Ello Privacy Policy
#### Updated Oct 03, 2014

## Your Privacy is Important
As an ad-free network that does not sell data about its users to third parties, Ello has also taken unique steps that help you control how much information about you is shared when you use Ello.

Please read this document in its entirety and take it seriously. It explains Ello's privacy practices, and what information we collect when you use our web site, mobile apps, services, products, and other content. It also explains how you can opt-out of sharing some of this information.

## Information Ello Collects
When you visit Ello, we may collect information about what pages you access, the device that you are using, information that you send to us directly or post on our web site or on your page, and the address of web sites that refer you to Ello. We also store the name and email address that you enter when you register for an account or contact us directly.

We may also collect and store an anonymized version of your IP address, which we may use to protect Ello and its users from spam, viruses, identity theft, illegal or harmful activities; we use this information to understand how people use Ello, which features work and which don't, and to help us develop and improve Ello's features and services.

Ello uses an anonymized version of Google Analytics to gather and aggregate general information about user behavior. To the best of our knowledge, the information gathered by Google on Ello’s behalf is collected in such a way that neither Ello, nor Google, can easily trace saved information back to any individual user.

Ello is unique in that we offer our users the option to opt-out of Google Analytics on the user settings page. We also respect “Do Not Track” browser settings. If you choose either of these options, we make best efforts not to send any data about your user behavior, anonymized or otherwise, to Google or any other third party service provider without your express permission. Please be aware that there may be other services that you are using and that are not controlled by Ello (including Google Search, Google Chrome Web Browser, Android Operating System, and Youtube) that may continue to send information to Google when you use Ello, even if you have asked us not to send information through our services.

We may create anonymous records by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.  We may use or share this anonymous data for any purpose — for example, to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may make Ello better.

## Email Communications
From time to time we may email you information about Ello that we think is necessary and important. By opening or maintaining an account with Ello, you agree to receive administrative and notification emails as part of your basic service. You can always opt-out of non-administrative emails.

If anyone ever contacts you and asks for your Ello password, they are probably trying to scam you. Ello will never do this. Please don't give your Ello password to anyone, and let us know about it if someone asks, so we can hunt them down and execute suitable punishment.

## Information Sharing
Ello does not make money from selling advertising.

We also don’t sell information about our users to any third party. This includes advertisers, data brokers, search engines, or anyone else.

We may share some of your personal information with third parties under several circumstances, including (1) if you tell us it is OK to do so (2) if we believe that we need to do so by law (3) if we contract with a third party service provider to offer services for you — for example, we may need to pass your payment information along to a credit card processing company if you decide to buy something on Ello.

Ello does not have any affiliated companies right now. But if we do in the future, we may share some information with them.

We will do our best to resist requests to access information that we believe are not justified. Ello's policy is to give you advance notice if we are going to release your information unless by law we are prohibited from doing so. If we think that disclosing your information may prevent serious harm to Ello, its users, you, or anyone else for that matter, we may do so without notifying you.

## Ello is a Public Network
Ello is a platform built for posting and sharing public content. You should assume that anything you post on Ello other than private messages will be accessed by others.

Search engines will be able to see the content you post. Content you post may be copied, shared, or re-posted on Ello and on other parts of the internet in ways that you and we cannot control.

We have made it easy for you to delete posted content from your personal account, and also to delete your account altogether (there’s a link to do so on your personal settings page).

However, we may store backups of your content on our servers, even after it is deleted or after you delete your account.

Furthermore, deleting your account or specific content doesn’t mean that your content hasn’t been copied or shared on Ello, and on other parts of the internet by people or services that have nothing to do with Ello.

We strongly suggest that you consider this when deciding what to post and what not to post on Ello (or anywhere on the Internet, for that matter). Please post responsibly!

## Ello and Cookies
Ello uses cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Ello Services. A cookie is a small amount of information that is stored in your web browser, which may contain information about you and the way you use the internet and services like Ello. We use cookies to identify our users, provide automatic login, and personalize your Ello experience. We also may use cookies embedded in emails to help figure out whether anyone is actually reading the drivel that we write.

You can turn cookies off on your web browser, but if you do, Ello may not work properly, and in some cases, you may not be able to log into Ello at all.

There are many other third party services and web sites that may place cookies in your browser. Our privacy policy only covers our use of Ello cookies, not cookies used by third parties.

## Data Storage and Deletion of Accounts and Data
You can access or change your personal profile and contact information or delete your account through your Ello personal settings page.

If you choose delete or deactivate your account, you can no longer retrieve your content or reactivate your account, and we cannot do so for you. Also, your username may become available for another person to use.

Ello stores its data on servers run by third parties. We or a third party we work with may keep backups of Ello’s data and code, which may or may not include posts and other information that you put on Ello, even after you have deleted your account. Therefore, even after you delete your account, your data may remain in backups on our system, although it will be no longer visible or publicly accessible on Ello.

## Children Under 13
Ello Services are intended for the general public, and are not meant for children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Please contact us if you become aware that a child under the age of 13 is using Ello, or has posted personal information about themselves on Ello, and we will work to remove both the information and the child’s Ello account.

## Changes to the Ello Privacy Policy
Ello may update this policy from time to time. We will let you know if we make signifiant changes by sending a notice to the email address connected with your Ello account, or by placing a notice in a prominent place on our web site.

You can also always find the most current version of this policy on our web site, as well as older versions.
